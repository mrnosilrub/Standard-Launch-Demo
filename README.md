# Standard-Launch-Demo

This demo includes a single `index.html` page. The page references
several asset files which are expected to be in an `assets/` directory:

- `assets/logo.png` – used for the favicon (`<link rel="icon">`) and as
  the Apple touch icon.
- `assets/logo.svg` – used as the mask icon and for the logo image in the
  navigation bar.

The HTML also links to a number of external resources:

- Unsplash images are used for the Open Graph metadata and material
  illustrations.
- Google Fonts and Font Awesome are loaded via CDN links.
- A Google Maps iframe is embedded and requires a valid API key.

No binary assets are included in this repository; the references above
are simply placeholders in `index.html`.
